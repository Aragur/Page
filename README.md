In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my french

*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**

* Item

* Item

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.

Check out this neat program I wrote:

```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
